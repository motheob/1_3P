      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm Motheo, a passionate and aspiring student developer. Welcome to my portfolio website, where you can learn more about me and explore the projects I've worked on. From the first "Hello World" program I wrote, I've been on an exciting adventure to explore various programming languages and technologies. Feel free to explore my portfolio section to see some of the projects I've worked on. Each project represents a learning journey and a chance to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work and learning more about my journey as a student developer.</p>
